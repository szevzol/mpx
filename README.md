My terminal multiplexer configuration.

This repository serves as a portable configuration for me.
Feel free to use it but please beware of the fact that I didn't prepared it to be used by others.

Description
-----------

I use both tmux and screen.

On unix environment I use tmux, because I like its pane management and its nice client-server architecture.

On windows (mintty) environment I cannot use tmux, because it's simply not possible. So under mintty I use screen with the same look and feel as in tmux.
