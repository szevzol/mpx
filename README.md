My terminal multiplexer configuration

I use both tmux and screen.

On unix environment I run tmux, because I like its pane management and the client-server architecture.

On windows (mintty) environment I cannot use tmux, becuase tmux cannot run there. Therefore I use screen and using the same look and feel as in tmux.
